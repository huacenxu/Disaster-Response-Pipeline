# Disaster Response Pipeline Project

## Project Motivation
In this project, I analyze disaster data from Figure Eight to build models that classify disaster messages. A machine learning pipeline is created to categorize these events to make sure that messages would be properly classified. Finally, I include a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories.

## Instruction
- Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.
  To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db
  To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl

- Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app. python run.py
